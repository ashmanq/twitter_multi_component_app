# Twitter Multi Component Vue App

This app was created to demonstrate the use of the Vue Javascript framework, using
components to create a modular web app.

## Using the app

The app consists of a form and three tweets already included when the app starts.
You can add 'tweets' using the submission form which will add the new tweet to the list.

The app will keep a constant tally of the total likes of the tweets in the list. There is also a filter
button that will allow you to toggle between 'popular apps' (apps with more than 10 likes) and all apps.

Clicking on a tweet will increase its number of likes. You can keep clicking to your hearts content!
