# Twitter Multi Component Vue App

This app was created to demonstrate the use of the Vue Javascript framework, using
components to create a modular web app.

## Using the app

* The app consists of a form and three tweets already included when the app starts.
* You can add 'tweets' using the submission form which will add the new tweet to the list.
* The app will keep a constant tally of the total likes of the tweets in the list. 
* A filter button allows you to toggle between 'popular tweets' (tweets with more than 10 likes) and all tweets.
* Clicking on a tweet will increase its number of likes. You can keep clicking to your hearts content!
